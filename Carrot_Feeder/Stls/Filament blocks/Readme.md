# Printing Instructions

## Filament Blocks
The filament blocks **require** supports. Furthermore, the support placement is important, otherwise it will be very difficult to remove. These instructions apply for the regular filament blocks and the bearing filament blocks.

### Organic Supports - Use these if your slicer supports it!

Organic supports make this easy - the support result should look something like this.

### Standard Supports

Unfortunately super slicer doesn't support organise supports, so more creative support placement is needed.

#### Support Settings
User superslicers paint on supports on these locations:

Using the following support settings:

#### Support Result
The support settings should look like this. A pre-supported Superslicer project has been included for reference.

If done correctly, the supports should just pop off.

### Can I print upright?

You may be tempted to print the part upright to reduce the amount of supports required. I would advise **NOT** doing this, for the reasons followed.

The overhanging surface in this orientation is the interface between the filament blocks and the 2020 extrusion. If this interface is not exactly the same between ALL filament blocks, it will cause variations of the filament gears between blocks. This leads to:
- the shaft having to 'snake' between filament block bearings. Added friction on the system.
- different heights between lower gears and top hats. Re-creates the need for different top hat tensioners - however removing them was a goal of this project

While it is technically possible to make this work (see above), this adds a lot of user-dependent inconsistency and therefore is **not recommended.**
