This directory contains the original CAD file for Clockwork 2 as of August 18, 2022.
This is the design on which the versions that have ECAS and filament sensor are based.

The VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner project commit as of this date is b2cf2c2. Here 
are a [link to that commit](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/tree/b2cf2c2c0436d734181688ae3019b9dffb835b8b) 
and a [link to the current version](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner) 
of that project.

This version of Voron-Stealthburner postdates RC1. Both the CW2 main body and the 
latch have been updated relative to RC1. RC1 versions of other parts are compatible with
this main body and latch.
