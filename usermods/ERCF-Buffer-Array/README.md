# ERCF-Buffer-Array

The Carrot Patch for the Enraged Rabbit Carrot Feeder has an integrated spool holder included. For people who store their spools in a drybox, this can be an issue. Either you have to store the buffer ring also in the dry box, which takes away space for filament spools, or one has to design a dedicated solution for the buffer ring outside of the dry box.

The Buffer Array solves this issue by dropping the spool holder and allows stacking up buffer rings side by side, called Buffer Array. One buffer ring element takes up 40mm of space (normal version) or 33.5mm (slim version). The Buffer Array is based on a modified main body so that all other required parts of the carrot patch can be re-used. The Buffer Array is modular an thus can be adapted to the size of your ERCF. For up to N=6, I also provide an integrated solution vor the V2.4, see image below.

Building a Buffer Array of length N>1 requires:
- the standard Carrot Patch parts:
  - 1x 608_Adapter.stl
  - 1x Buffer_Axis.stl
  - 1x Buffer_Cross.stl
  - 1x Buffer_Wheel.stl
  - 1x feet_x2.stl or Feet_cut_off.stl
- 1x "Buffer Array Start"
- (N-2)x Buffer Array Middle
- 1x Buffer Array End
- recommended for stability: multi-locker with or without guide for ptfe tubing
- 1x M5x30mm and 1x m5 lock nut
- 1x M3x20mm, 1x M3x8mm, 2x M3 heat insert (Voron version M3x5x4)
- 608ZZ bearing

If you already have old carrot patches, then you can recycle all parts except the heat inserts!
If you want only N=1 then there is also "Buffer array Stand-Alone" available.

If you want to integrate an 6x ERCF with buffer array and spool holder on your back of your V2.4 (350mm), then use the special multi-locker and spool holder in the " V2.4-Integration", see image below.
