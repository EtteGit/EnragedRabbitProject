## Enraged Rabbit : Carrot Feeder config file for ERCF EASY BRD v1.1
##
## IMPORTANT J6 Jumper setting:
## Option 1: Pins 2-3 and 4-5, i.e.  .[..][..]
## This is for sensorless selector setup. Note that this enables the option disables the "extra"
## switch so the toolhead sensor (if used) would have to be connected to the main mcu
##
## Option 2: Pins 1-2 and 4-5, i.e.  [..].[..]
## It you are NOT using sensorless selector. The "extra" switch is enabled for other uses
