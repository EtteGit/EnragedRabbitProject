# Printable Mounts
#### Printable supports for mounting the ERCF and [ERCP Array](https://github.com/miguelangel-nubla/EnragedRabbitProject/tree/main/usermods/ERCF-Buffer-Array) to the 2020 aluminium extrusions on a Voron V2 (and potentially Trident) without having to purchase aditional profiles and angle corners.

# Printing instructions

* All parts fit on the buildplate of a machine with the target size. 45 Degree Z rotation is encouraged.

# BOM per mount:

* M3x8mm bolts: 6x for 6U-ERCF and 12x for the 6U ERCP Array.
* Standard Voron M3x5x4 heatinserts, same as M3x8mm bolts.
* 4x M5x25mm bolts (for 3mm panels + 1mm foam, check yours)
* 4x M5 T-Nuts
* You will also need 4x [wedges](https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject/tree/main/Carrot_Feeder/Stls/Supports/V1%20or%20V2) that fit your panels!

# Modifications
If you need to modify the CAD files, Fusion 360 likes to crash with load of the geometry from the hexagonal pattern.
To aleviate the workload a bit, right click on the rectangular pattern of the first sketch, set both quantities to 1, then do your changes and at the end restore the quantities to the original value to cover the needed area.
