# ERCP upside down mounting mod

This mod allows the ERCP to be mounted upside-down, for example, below a shelf
above your printer.

Because gravity cannot be cheated, we need a bit of additional hardware.

# Printing instructions

* Print the base as the unmodded one
* Print the arms upside-down
* You might wish to re-print the unmodded sliding arm mirrored if the filament path
  is too sharp

# BOM per ERCP:

* 1 heat set insert M3x⌀5mmx4mm
* 1 SHCS M3x10 screw

# Assembly changes

* Insert the heat set insert into the hole closest to the base.
* The PTFE tube is now inserted from the opposite side

# Notes

* The whole assembly within a working ERCF isn't tested so far, feedback is appreciated
* The long arm is untested so far
* Only have a look at the source SCAD files if you really have to. Due to the lack
  of proper code re-formatting tools which actually work and due to my lazyness the
  code is pretty ugly.
